# Dataset description
The dataset reports the percentage of the population with access to electricity across different countries worldwide.
This value is one of the key international indicators used to assess a country’s level of energy development.

The information comes from institutional sources such as the World Bank and the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative, which compile data from industries, energy agencies, national surveys, and other official bodies.
The dataset is also linked to the themes of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), which aims to ensure modern, sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy for all.


# Analysis Overview

The analysis explores the distribution of energy consumption across countries, the variability between continents (with a particular focus on Asia and Europe), and the relationships between yearly values. Several visualizations were produced, such as histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, heatmaps, and stripplots, to highlight trends and differences. The results reveal clear continental disparities and strong year-to-year correlations, supporting further investigation and potential predictive modelling.
